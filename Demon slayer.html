                The Demon Slayer Corps (鬼殺隊, Kisatsutai) are an organization that has existed since ancient times and is
                dedicated to protect humankind from demons. There are hundreds of Demon Slayers within the organization,
                but they act in secrecy, even from the Japanese government. The most powerful swordsmen among the Demon
                Slayers are the Hashira (柱; lit. Pillars), who serve as its elite warriors.

                            a distant relative of Muzan, resulting in his bloodline being cursed with a disease that
                            slowly kills them before reaching their thirties due to their connection with Muzan's blood.
                            He is gentle but firm and has dedicated himself to leading the Corps, garnering the respect
                            of the Demon Slayers he commands. He sacrifices himself to weaken Muzan with a suicide
                            bombing, exploiting Muzan's sadistic pleasure in listening to his last words before

                            The Stone Hashira, regarded as the most powerful combatant in the Demon Slayer Corps. A
                            former monk, he was falsely imprisoned after children under his care were killed by a demon,
                            leading him to be distrustful and cynical. He initially distrusts Tanjiro Kamado due to his
                            sister's demon nature but later acknowledges his integrity. He wields a massive kusarigama
                            instead of a standard Nichirin sword. Gyomei plays a critical role in the battles against
                            the Upper Rank demon Kokushibo and Muzan Kibutsuji, during which he loses a leg. He succumbs
                            to his injuries after Muzan's defeat.

                            The Mist Hashira, an aloof yet secretly caring figure. A descendant of Demon Slayers of the
                            past, he was orphaned as a child with only his older twin brother Yuichiro as family. After
                            Yuichiro was killed protecting him from a demon, he suffers survivor's guilt, becoming an
                            amnesiac and losing his childhood memories. He is initially distrustful of Tanjiro, but
                            becomes much more friendly to him after regaining his memories and coming in terms with his
                            survival. During the attack on the Swordsmith Village, he defeats Gyokko. Muichiro is killed
                            in action against Kokushibo, who is revealed to be his distant ancestor. In the Reiwa era,
                            he and his brother are reincarnated as infant twins.

                            airheaded. Unlike her fellow Demon Slayers, she did not join the Corps due to tragedies
                            caused by demons, rather doing so in a way to be herself instead of conforming to society
                            and marrying. She possesses enhanced flexibility and physical strength because of her dense
                            musculature, and wields a whip-like Nichirin sword. She has an interest in cooking, able to
                            make pancakes which are unseen in the Taishō era. She is pivotal in the defeat of Hantengu
                            at Swordsmith Village and later battles his successor Nakime alongside Obanai. During the
                            final battle against Muzan, she is mortally wounded and declares her love for Obanai, dying
                            alongside him. In the Reiwa Era, they are reincarnated as a married couple who work as
                            restaurateurs.

                            The Flame Hashira and successor to his father Shinjuro. Though he comes off as boisterous
                            and eccentric, he is pure-hearted and honorable, as his mother instilled in him a moral code
                            of protecting the weak. He is assigned to investigate the Mugen Train, with Tanjiro,
                            Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko aiding him in dispatching Enmu. After the battle, Akaza
                            confronts him and proposes that he turn into a demon, having recognized his skill and
                            strength. Kyojuro rejects this and battles him, but is ultimately killed. In his last
                            moments, he directs Tanjiro to Shinjuro on his quest to discover more about Hinokami Kagura.
                            Tanjiro later has the tsuba of Kyojuro's sword installed into his new sword to honor him. In

                            The Water Hashira and the first Demon Slayer that Tanjiro meets. He initially tries to kill
                            Nezuko but reconsiders after she protects Tanjiro from him, and directs them to his mentor
                            Sakonji Urokodaki in hopes that Tanjiro could succeed him and possibly cure Nezuko. Beneath
                            his aloof and unemotional exterior, he suffers from an inferiority complex stemming from
                            survivor's guilt during Final Selection, where his best friend Sabito dies after killing all
                            but one demon, leading him to be unconfident in his skills as a Hashira. He developed an
                            additional self-taught form of Water Breathing. Giyu and Tanjiro battle Akaza in the
                            Infinity Castle, and later are the first to face Muzan. He loses his left arm during the
                            battle, but survives. Giyu has a descendent in the present day named Giichi, who is close
                            friends with Sabito and Makomo's reincarnations.

                            her motif. She is seemingly cool-headed and optimistic and enjoys teasing others,
                            particularly Giyu, but beneath her cheerful façade is a constantly angry and vengeful figure
                            motivated solely by her hatred of demons, who killed her family one after another, to the
                            point of deriving sadistic pleasure from killing demons. However, she is caring towards
                            humans, including her subordinates, Tsuyuri Kanao and the Kamados after Nezuko was allowed
                            to stay. Due to her small frame preventing her from traditionally beheading demons, she
                            wields a thin, sting-like Nichirin sword to inject them with a wisteria-based poison she
                            made. This expertise allows her to assist Tamayo in developing the cure for Nezuko and in
                            concocting a mixture of drugs to weaken Muzan, working with her despite her initial hatred
                            for Tamayo's demon status. Shinobu sacrifices herself to defeat Doma, having previously
                            taken massive doses of wisteria to ensure he would be poisoned when he devoured her,
                            allowing Kanao and Inosuke to kill him. In the present day, she and Kanae are reincarnated
                            as high school students.

                            worshipped simply for being the first male in their lineage in years, when Shinjuro Rengoku
                            rescued him. He joined the Demon Slayer Corps as a means to vent his rage at his family
                            being destroyed through their association with the demon. He is in love with Mitsuri, being
                            unusually open and relaxed in her presence, and is jealous when she apparently becomes close
                            to others. During the final battle, he and Mitsuri battle Nakime before joining the fight
                            against Muzan, in which he and Kaburamaru provide assistance. After the battle, he declares

                            One of Shinobu's adoptive sisters. Despite surviving the Final Selection to become a Demon
                            Slayer, she is too afraid to fight on the frontlines and instead oversees the rehabilitation
                            of wounded Demon Slayers who are treated at the Butterfly Mansion. She eventually co-owns
                            the Butterfly Mansion after Shinobu's death and marries Inosuke, having two
                            great-grandchildren.

                            One of the swordsmiths who makes swords for the Demon Slayer Corps, and is assigned to forge
                            Tanjiro's sword. He is an extremely aggressive figure who is extremely dedicated to his work
                            to a fault, angered whenever Tanjiro breaks or loses his sword, only calming down when he is
                            given dango. After Tanjiro's numerous swords breaking from demon attacks, he realizes his
                            mistakes and weaknesses in his blades, motivating him to improve his physical ability in a
                            nearby forest in order to improve his craftsmanship. He polished Yoriichi Tsugikini's sword
                            for Tanjiro, who used it to defeat Muzan. He has a descendant in the present day.

                            A swordsmith who makes swords for the Demon Slayer Corps, who made Inosuke's blades and is
                            later assigned to make Muichiro Tokito's blade. Despite being less aggressive than Hotaru,
                            he is also angered at Inosuke purposely chipping his swords. He is nearly killed during
                            Gyokko's attack on the Swordsmith Village, but Muichiro saves him. He has a descendant in
                            the present day.

                            Yoriichi. He is injured by one of Gyokko's demons during the attack on the Swordsmith
                            Village, but Muichiro saves him. Unlike other Swordsmith Village inhabitants, his face is
                            comically alike with the mask he wears, in comparison to the villagers' fair apperance. He
                            has a descendant in the present day.
